<p align="justify">  
I am a PhD candidate in applied microeconomics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My supervisors are <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/maarten-lindeboom" style="color: black;">Maarten Lindeboom</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nadineketel/" style="color: black;">Nadine Ketel</a>. In January and February 2025, I visited the Center of Economic Performance (CEP) at the London School of Economics.

I am interested in Intergenerational Mobility and the Economics of Education. I typically use large administrative datasets in combination with causal inference or machine learning techniques to answer relevant questions in these areas. For examples, please see my research page.
