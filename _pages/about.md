I am a PhD candidate in applied microeconomics at the Free University Amsterdam. My supervisors are <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/maarten-lindeboom" style="color: black;">Maarten Lindeboom</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nadineketel/" style="color: black;">Nadine Ketel</a>. 
  
In my research I use causal inference techniques with administrative data to improve our understanding of the determinants of children's human capital.
