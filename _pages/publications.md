My research aims to investigate the determinants of children's human capital, encompassing their cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills and health. Understanding the factors that contribute to children's outcomes is crucial in constructing what economists refer to as the human capital production function. This knowledge is valuable for academics to explain observed levels of human capital and for policymakers to optimize policy strategies for productivity and well-being. Additionally, parents can benefit from insights into how their children's well-being and outcomes are influenced by their childhood environment.
